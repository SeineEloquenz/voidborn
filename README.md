The Voidborn is a species mod based on the "The Pallid" mod and portraits of Krabiel. All credit for the base portraits go to him. His mod can be found here:

This mod is **not** compatible with "The Pallid" Mod and most likely won't be for the near future. There aren't any other conflicts that I'm aware of.

This mod features:

* A female only corrupted human species based on the pallid species with new hair and more outfits as well as an updated lore
* The original Dark Ones from the Pallid mod
* A dark human species infested with the fungoid parasite from the base game
* A prescripted empire for each of the species
* A city set for the prescripted empires
* Custom diplo phrases for corrupted species
* Custom governments for corrupted empires equivalent to the holy tribunal, theocratic monarchy, theocratic dictatorship and devouring swarm

For the prescripted empires you need the DLCs which feature syncretic evolution, the tombworld start civic, as well as the devouring swarm gestalt government
